# Artifact Status

This artifact is for "Verifying Dynamic Trait Objects in Rust", accepted to ICSE SEIP (which is not double-blinded).

We are seeking the following badges:

### 1. Artifact Available

Our artifact is available as an archival repository on [Zenodo][] with DOI: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5915215.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5915215)


In addition, our [Kani Rust Verifier][kani] has been open-source throughout its development.

### 2. Artifact Evaluated - Reusable

We have provided code, data, and scripts to reproduce the main empirical claims in our paper: (1) our analysis of the use of dynamic objects in popular crates (packages), (2) two case studies using Kani on an open source virtualization project, and (3) a comparison of Kani and other Rust verification tools on our new open source suite of test cases. 

The [main Kani source code][kani] is publicly under active development.
