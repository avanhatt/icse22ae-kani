# Artifact Evaluation: Kani Rust Verifier (Kani)

These instructions are hosted in an archival repository at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5914906.


# Abstract
This directory contains the evaluation scripts for our ICSE SEIP paper, Verifying Dynamic Trait Objects in Rust.

The [Kani Rust Verifier (Kani)][kani] is a new tool for Rust that can verify important safety properties, from memory faults in unsafe Rust code to user-defined correctness assertions. 
To our knowledge, our tool is the first symbolic modeling checking tool for Rust that can verify correctness while supporting the breadth of dynamic trait objects, including dynamic closures. 
Our ICSE SEIP focuses on the challenges in reasoning about Rust's _dynamic trait objects_, a feature that provides dynamic dispatch for function abstractions.
In this artifact, we provide instructions for reproducing each of a major empirical results in the paper: (1) our analysis of the use of dynamic objects in popular crates (packages), (2) two case studies using Kani on an open source virtualization project, and (3) a comparison of Kani and other Rust verification tools on our new open source suite of test cases.

# Empirical results

This artifact includes steps to replicate the following results:

1. **Section 4.1: Prevalence of dynamic trait objects.** We conducted a simple study to estimate the prevalence of dynamic trait objects in the 500 most downloaded crates (packages) on crates.io, the Rust package repository.  This artifact should reproduce that 37% of crates use explicit dynamic trait objects, and 70% of crates use them implicitly.
2. **Section 4.2: Case study: Firecracker.** We conduct case studies on [Firecracker][], an open source virtualization technology.
We compare two versions of Kani, one with our new function pointer restriction algorithm and one without. Reviewers should be able to reproduce an improvement of 5% in verification time for the first case, and an improvement of 15Ã— for the second case.
3. **4.3: Dynamic Dispatch Test Suite.** We compare the cases handled by Kani and other related Rust verification tools. For 8 selected cases, we compare Kani with [Crux-MIR][], [Rust Verification Tools][rvt] - [Seahorn][], Rust Verification Tools - [KLEE][], [SMACK - Rust][smack-rust], [Prusti][], and [CRUST][]. We also present our suite of 40 total verification test cases for other researchers to use. For this artifact, reviewers should be able to reproduce the results of Table 1.

There are two components to this artifact:
1. **Kani Rust Verifier (Kani):** This is our publicly available verifier for Rust. Kani (formerly known as the Rust Model Checker (RMC)) contains code from the Rust compiler and is distributed under the terms of both the MIT license and the Apache License (Version 2.0). We also include two case studies of the performance of Kani on example from the open source Firecracker project.
2. **Verification test cases and comparison to related work:** Our contributions include an open-source suite of verification test cases, kept up-to-date on [our project Github][dyn-tests]. In addition, we translate 8 representative cases to the syntax of related work tools. Reproducing this component requires a very large number of software dependencies, since each tool is build on a different language stack (i.e., multiple versions of Rust, LLVM, Haskell, OCaml, etc). We have packaged these dependencies into a Docker instance; however, the instance is around 30GB.
  
We estimate the required components of this artifact to take around 1.5 hour of reviewer time.

# Prerequisites

## Docker
#### Time estimate: 5 minutes.

We provide our artifact as a [Docker][docker] instance. Users should install Docker based on their system's instructions.

[docker]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

## Machine requirements

Our full Docker image contains 3 related work projects that each have many dependencies (Crux-MIR, Rust Verification Tools, and SMACK), which increases both the size of the instance and the requirements for the host machine. The instance is around 30GB. 

----

# Part 0: Fetch and run the Docker instance

#### Time estimate: 30 minutes (depending on internet connection).

The remainder of this artifact assumes all commands are run within the Docker instance.

To interactively run the Docker instance, run the following:

```
docker run -i -t --rm ghcr.io/avanhatt/icse22ae-kani:0.1
```

# Part 1: Section 4.1: Prevalence of dynamic trait objects.
#### Time estimate: 10 minutes.

This section includes a simple study to get a rough estimate of the prevalence of our feature of interest, dynamic trait objects, within the Rust ecosystem. 

This component of the artifact consists of a python script that (1) downloads the top 500 crates sorted by greatest number of downloads, (2) estimates the number of explicit trait objects by search for the `dyn` keywords, and (3) estimates the number of implicit dynamic trait objects by searching a debug output of compiling with Rust for the line `get_vtable`, which is logged at vtable use.

Running the script for all 500 crates takes over an hour, since it involves a debug built of each crate. Instead, we can look at just the top 50 crates, which should take under 10 minutes (the most popular crates also tend to be smaller).

Run the script for the top 50 crates with:
```bash
cd /icse22ae-kani/crate-data
time make
```

You should see some per-crate output, then the following summary, where `nonzero-pct` indicates the percentage of crates where each type of dynamic trait object is found, which should _roughly_ correspond with the percentages over a large number of crates in the paper (37% and 70%) in the paper.

```
Summary for trait counts
python3 summarize.py < explicit.json
{
  "mean": 3.6,
  "median": 0.0,
  "nonzero": 18,
  "nonzero-pct": "36",
  "total": 50
}
python3 summarize.py < implicit.json
{
  "mean": 55.58,
  "median": 17.0,
  "nonzero": 40,
  "nonzero-pct": "80",
  "total": 50
}
``

Note: by default this will use the already-downloaded crate data at `/icse22ae-kani/crate-data/db-dump.tar.gz`. To optionally re-download the data, run `rm /icse22ae-kani/crate-data/db-dump.tar.gz` before the previous command (the command will then take an additional 30+ minutes, depending on the host machine).

### Optional: run for all 500 crates

Running all 500 crates will take over an hour:
```bash
# Optional!
cd /icse22ae-kani/crate-data
time make 500-report
```

Where you can expect this full result:

```bash
Summary for trait counts
python3 summarize.py < explicit.json
{
  "mean": 5.884,
  "median": 0.0,
  "nonzero": 189,
  "nonzero-pct": "38",
  "total": 500
}
python3 summarize.py < implicit.json
{
  "mean": 149.874,
  "median": 14.0,
  "nonzero": 349,
  "nonzero-pct": "70",
  "total": 500
}
```

# Part 2: Section 4.2: Case study: Firecracker.
#### Time estimate: 30 minutes.

In these case studies, we consider how two different variants of Kani---one with our new vtable function pointer restrictions (as described in Section 3.3), and one
without---perform on examples from the open source [Firecracker][] hypervisor written in Rust.

### Case Study 1: Firecracker Serial Device

In this first illustrative example, we consider a case that uses explicit dynamic trait object types.

This component of Firecracker defines the following trait:

```rust
// Docker at: /icse22ae-kani/case-study-1/firecracker/src/devices/src/bus.rs
pub trait BusDevice: AsAny + Send {
    /// Reads at `offset` from this device
    fn read(&mut self, offset: u64, data: &mut [u8]) {}
    /// Writes at `offset` into this device
    fn write(&mut self, offset: u64, data: &[u8]) {}
}
```

We add a straightforward test harness with Kani to check that `read` and `write` can be dynamically dispatched. First, the test sets up necessary structs, then checks the value from `read` and `write` dispatched dynamically through an explicit `dyn BusDevice` trait object.

```rust
// Docker at: /icse22ae-kani/case-study-1/firecracker/src/devices/src/legacy/serial.rs
fn serial_harness() {
    // --------------------------------- SETUP --------------------------------
    // This test requires the Serial device be in loopback mode, i.e., 
    // setting is_in_loop_mode to return true in 
    // https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-superio/blob/main/crates/vm-superio/src/serial.rs
    let serial_out = SharedBuffer::new();
    let intr_evt = EventFdTrigger::new(EventFd{}); 
    let mut serial = SerialDevice {
    serial: Serial::new(
            intr_evt,
            Box::new(serial_out.clone()),
        ),
        input: None,
    };
    let bytes: [u8; 1] = kani::any();

    // ------------------------- Dynamic trait objects ------------------------
    // Dynamic dispatch through `dyn BusDevice`
    <dyn BusDevice>::write(&mut serial, 0u64, &bytes);

    let mut read = [0x00; 1];

    // Dynamic dispatch through `dyn BusDevice`
    <dyn BusDevice>::read(&mut serial, 0u64, &mut read);

    // Verify expected value is read
    assert!(bytes[0] == read[0]);
}
```

First, we'll run Kani on this harness without restrictions. `serial-no-restrictions.sh` is a bash script that runs Kani by invoking the custom Kani backend to the Rust compiler, combining the produced CBMC files per crate, anf finally invoking the solver.

Run the script with:
```bash
cd /icse22ae-kani/case-study-1/firecracker/
time ./serial-no-restrictions.sh
```

This should complete with in around 2 minutes with:
```bash
VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL
```

The second version of this script, `serial-with-restrictions.sh`, adds a flag to restrict function pointers based on Rust-level type information.

Run the script with:
```bash
cd /icse22ae-kani/case-study-1/firecracker/
time ./serial-with-restrictions.sh
```

Depending on the host machine, this will complete with in a time 5%-50% faster than the example without restrictions, again with:
```
VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL
```

### Case Study 2: Firecracker Firecracker Block Device Parser

In this second, larger case study, we consider an example where an _implicit_ dynamic trait objects poses surprising challenges for verification. 

This component of Firecracker contains the following function to parse virtual guest transactions.

```rust
// Docker at /icse22ae-kani/case-study-2/firecracker/src/devices/src/virtio/block/request.rs
impl Request {
    pub fn parse(
        avail_desc: &DescriptorChain,
        mem: &GuestMemoryMmap,
    ) -> result::Result<Request, Error> {
        // ...
    }
```

Again, we write a test harness to run with Kani that checks that parse returns without any memory safety issues:
```rust
    // Docker at /icse22ae-kani/case-study-2/firecracker/src/devices/src/virtio/block/request.rs
    fn parse_harness() {
        let mem = GuestMemoryMmap::new();
        let queue_size: u16 = kani::any();
        kani::assume(is_nonzero_pow2(queue_size));

        let index: u16 = kani::any();
        let desc_table = GuestAddress(kani::any::<u64>());
        {
            match DescriptorChain::checked_new(&mem, desc_table, queue_size, index) {
                Some(desc) => {
                    kani::assume((index as u64) * 16 < u64::MAX - desc_table.0);
                    let addr = desc_table.0 + (index as u64) * 16;
                    assert!(desc.index == index);
                    assert!(desc.index < queue_size);
                    if desc.has_next() {
                        assert!(desc.next < queue_size);
                    }

                    // Call `parse`, the function under verification
                    match Request::parse(&desc, &mem) {
                        Ok(req) => {}
                        Err(err) => {}
                    }
                },
                None => {},
            }
        }
    }
```

When we run this function under Kani's, even with only basic checks enabled, the backing symbolic execution engine (CBMC) fails to even finish processing the loop unwinding within over 4 hours. This is because `parse`'s return type of `result::Result<Request, Error>` contains an `Error` type that is implicitly destructed through a dynamic `Drop` trait which has over 300 possible virtual function targets.

To demonstrate that the default Kani without restrictions fails to handle this case, run the command below to observe that Kani never gets past loop unwinding. Note that we run a `basic-checks` version that only enables basic checking for CBMC, rather than Kani's full checks.

```bash
cd /icse22ae-kani/case-study-2/firecracker/
time ./parse-no-restrictions-basic-checks.sh
```

After an initial Rust build output (~3 minutes), you should see commands of the following format printed to the console, without ever reaching a solver state:
```bash
adding goto-destructor code on jump to 'bb52'
file /scratch/alexa/icse22ae-kani/case-study-2/firecracker/src/devices/src/virtio/mmio.rs line 313 column 21 function <virtio::mmio::MmioTransport as bus::BusDevice>::write: adding goto-destructor code on jump to 'bb53'
```

Once you have seen enough of these statements (or after 20 minutes has past), kill the command with `ctrl-C`.

Now, we can run the command _with_ function pointer restrictions enabled. Here, the loop unwinding processing should complete within 5 minutes, with the entire verification completing within 20 minutes (depending on host machine).

```bash
cd /icse22ae-kani/case-study-2/firecracker/
time ./parse-with-restrictions-basic-checks.sh
```

Now, this should complete with:
```bash
VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL
```

### Optional: run with more checks

To run with more than just the basic checks, you can run the following two commands. While the second command completes within 16 minutes on the large AWS EC2 instance used in the paper, we found it takes >30 minutes to run on a laptop, so we leave this component as optional. The speedup described in the paper should still be reasonably represented without additional checks.

```bash
# Optional!
cd /icse22ae-kani/case-study-2/firecracker/
time ./parse-with-restrictions-more-checks.sh
```

# Part 3: 4.3: Dynamic Dispatch Test Suite.
#### Time estimate: 5 minutes.

Table 1 includes a summary of how related Rust verifications tools perform on a representative subset of our verification test cases.

To reproduce this table, we have written versions of each test per tool. Each test is modified for the syntax expected by that tool. For example, SMACK requires asserts be written as `smack::assert!(...)`, and Rust Verification Tools requires an entire crate to execute rather than a single Rust file. Each test is within `/icse22ae-kani/<tool name>/*`. 

To compare each tool, we provide a Python `compare_tools.py` script. This script runs each test and checks for tool-specific success or failure strings. You should see results printed for each tool, then a `Results summary table` printed to standard out. All results should be either `SUCCESS` is verification succeeds or `FAILURE` if it does not. An `UNKNOWN` result indicates the tool has failed to run as expected, or did not produce the expected success or failure string(s) in its output.

To reproduce Table 1, run the following inside the Docker:
```bash
cd /icse22ae-kani/tests
python3 compare_tools.py
```

After reporting the results as each tool is run, you should see a results summary table of the following form:

```bash
---------------------- Results summary table --------------------------
Tests:
0 : simple-trait-pointer
1 : simple-trait-boxed
2 : auto-trait-pointer
3 : fn-closure-pointer
4 : fnonce-closure-boxed
5 : generic-trait-pointer
6 : explicit-drop-boxed
7 : explicit-drop-pointer

  Tests  Kani     Crux-MIR    RVT-SH    RVT-KLEE    SMACK
-------  -------  ----------  --------  ----------  -------
      1  SUCCESS  SUCCESS     FAILURE   SUCCESS     SUCCESS
      2  SUCCESS  FAILURE     FAILURE   SUCCESS     FAILURE
      3  SUCCESS  FAILURE     FAILURE   SUCCESS     SUCCESS
      4  SUCCESS  FAILURE     FAILURE   SUCCESS     SUCCESS
      5  SUCCESS  FAILURE     FAILURE   SUCCESS     FAILURE
      6  SUCCESS  FAILURE     FAILURE   SUCCESS     SUCCESS
      7  SUCCESS  FAILURE     SUCCESS   SUCCESS     FAILURE
      8  SUCCESS  SUCCESS     SUCCESS   SUCCESS     SUCCESS
```
_Note, we are seeing more failures on Docker for RVT-SH than what we observed in the paper._

To rerun any specific tool(s), you can run, for example, `python3 compare_tools.py --tool kani smack`.

Two other Rust verification tools, Prusti and CRUST, do not support any of the dynamic trait objects we tested. See Prusti's [error on unsized casts][prusti-err], and CRUST's documentation of "[CRUST] currently lacks support for dynamic dispatch of trait methods and for closures" [here][crust].

[prusti-err]: https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev/blob/v-2021-11-22-1738/prusti-viper/src/encoder/mir/pure/interpreter/mod.rs#L276

# Further notes on Reusability

To prepare this artifact, this repository's `Dockerfile` includes installation of 4 Rust verification tools---Kani, Crux-MIR, Rust Verification Tools, and SMACK - Rust (though any mistakes in the installation or usage are solely our fault, not the fault of the authors of those tools!) These installation steps may be useful to other researchers aiming to compare tools for verifying Rust. 

In addition, our `crate-data/crate_scrape.py` tool may be useful for other analyses on popular Rust crates---researchers can change the bash command run in the script to produce custom numerical results.

Exit the Docker terminal with `ctrl+d`. Thank you for your time!
